## Synthetic population pipeline for ÃŽle-de-France
## based on the synpp package

# This is the path to a directory where the pipeline can store temporary data
working_directory: C:/Users/biao.yin/Documents/MATSIM/Project/scenarios/synthetic_population/cache_IDF_egt_1pm

# This section defines which parts of the pipeline should be run
run:
  - synthesis.output_test
  #- synthesis.output # To create the output population in the output_path (see below)
  #- matsim.output # Uncomment, if you want to run the full simulation (you'll need Java for that)

# Here the configuraiton of the pipeline starts
config:
  # Some general configuration
  processes: 4

  # Define whether to use ENTD or EGT as the household travel survey (HTS)
  hts: egt

  # Define sampling rate and random seed for the output population
  sampling_rate: 0.001
  random_seed: 1234

  # Paths to the input data and where the output should be stored
  data_path: C:/Users/biao.yin/Documents/MATSIM/Project/synthetic_population/data_IDF
  output_path: C:/Users/biao.yin/Documents/MATSIM/Project/scenarios/synthetic_population/output_IDF_egt_1pm

  # Only interesting if you run the simulation
  java_memory: 14G
  export_detailed_network: False
  
  

  # Uncommented below to enable vehicle fleet generation
  # generate_vehicles_file: True
  # generate_vehicles_method: fleet_sample
